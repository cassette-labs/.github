# Cassette Labs
Cassette Labs is a creative space where brilliant minds come together to build the future.
Think of it as the garage where the next big thing gets its start. We provide the space, the tools, the community, and the expertise to work on something that matters.
Some projects will stay free forever. Others might become commercial success and we'll celebrate that together. All of them will be born from the same passion.

## Concept
Cassette Labs follows a community model, every project created under the organization is a part of it. Resources are pooled to help new projects start.
We focus on open source projects, but there is no restriction for anyone to start a commercial project with community's support. We share success proportional to the investment. 

## Community Guidelines
